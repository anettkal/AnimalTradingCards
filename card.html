			 					<p id="animal-description">The red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like body and thick russet fur. Almost 50% of the red panda’s habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. Primarily an herbivore, the name panda is said to come from the Nepali word ‘ponya,’ which means bamboo or plant eating animal.</p>
